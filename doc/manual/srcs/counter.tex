The OpenTTP reference platform uses an Opal Kelly XEM6001 FPGA (Xilinx Spartan 6 LX16) development board to provide a multi-channel counter.
The counter is clocked at 200 MHz, so the full-range resolution is 5 ns. 
This is adequate for the applications envisaged for the OpenTTP system.

Although the counter has six channels, only three (FIXME four?) are connected in the current design \ref{f:counter}.
They are all configured with the system reference as START, with the exception of Channel 5.
This is configured with the externally input 1 pps as START, and the time-transfer receiver's 1 pps as STOP.
This is to allow time-transfer for an external reference.

The XEM6001 has eight LEDS which may aid in fault-finding \ref{t:XEM6001LEDs}. In particular, the presence of 1 pps signals 
can be readily seen (the pulses are extended so that they are visible) and the lock state of the PLL producing the 200 MHz clock.
