The Open Traceable Time Platform is an open-source solution for a timing system that can be made fully
traceable to national standards. It achieves traceability using the GPS common-view technique, 
which allows distant clocks to be compared with an accuracy of a few ns. 
The reference platform is based on readily available, low-cost OEM modules and provides a full software and hardware solution.
