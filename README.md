The Open Traceable Time Platform is an open-source solution for a timing system that can be made fully
traceable to national standards. It achieves traceability using the GPS common-view technique, 
which allows distant clocks to be compared with an accuracy of a few ns. 
The reference platform is based on readily available, low-cost OEM modules and provides a full software and hardware solution.

Documentation can be built for LaTex source in the doc/manual directory by running 'make'.
The documentation contains instructions for a minimal setup.
A PDF of the documentation is also available at www.openttp.org/scripts/docs.php
