# You do need to talk to an NTP server or two (or three).
#server ntp.your-provider.example

# pool.ntp.org maps to about 1000 low-stratum NTP servers.  Your server will
# pick a different set every time it starts up.  Please consider joining the
# pool: <http://www.pool.ntp.org/join.html>

# 127.127.20.x is the NMEA server:
#  mode 209 means we use the GPRMC sentence (it contains the time and date)
#           and we communicate at 115200 baud, and we write recognised NMEA sentences
#           to the clockstat file.  Remember to uncomment the statistics and
#           filegen lines above.
# In the fudge line:
#  flag1 0 disables the PPS processing (it is expected in the DCD line)
#  time2 {time} means that the GPRMC sentence is delayed by this much, so we can correct for that
#        for configuring it is set to 0.0, add clockstats to the statictics line above to log
#        the delays and then use that value to correct the delay, then remove clockstats from the
#        statistics line to conserve disk space. Remember to restart ntp!

# 127.127.22.x is the PPS clock driver
# REF (LTE-Lite GPSDO 1PPS) is /dev/pps0
# GPS (NV08C 1PPS) is /dev/pps1
# In the fudge lines:
#  time1 0.0 means that the 1PPS arrives exactly on time: 0.0 (seconds.fraction) late 
#  flag2 0 specifies rising edge must be used
#  flag3 0 controls PPS kernel behaviour - 0 disables this
#  flag4 1 specfies a time stamp will be recorded once a second
